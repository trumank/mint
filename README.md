Mods are added via URL to a .pak or .zip containing a .pak. Mods can also be pulled from mod.io.
Examples:

 - `C:\Path\To\Local\Mod.zip`
 - `https://example.org/some-online-mod-repository/public-mod.pak`
 - `https://mod.io/g/drg/m/sandbox-utilities`

Mods from mod.io will require an OAuth token which can be obtained from <https://mod.io/me/access>
when prompted.
